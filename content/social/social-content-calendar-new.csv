1,Website Builds,Facebook,"Real talk: How long has your website been ""in progress""?

I've seen businesses wait 6+ months for sites that should take weeks. That's time you're losing customers.

At Need This Done, we build custom websites starting at $500. Most projects: 1-4 weeks from start to launch.

No templates. No excuses. Just a site that works.

2,Automation Setup,LinkedIn,"You're still doing THAT manually?

Every week, small businesses lose hours to repetitive tasks:
→ Copying data between apps
→ Sending the same follow-up emails
→ Updating spreadsheets by hand

At $150 per workflow, automation pays for itself fast.

What's eating your time? Let's fix it.

$150 per workflow. Most clients save 5-10 hours per week.

The math speaks for itself.
