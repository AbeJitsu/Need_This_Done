Target positioning: AI tools made accessible for non-technical small business owners

---

## Page-by-Page Analysis

### Homepage (/)

**Current purpose:** Introduces NeedThisDone as a generalist task service with three offerings (Virtual Assistant, Data & Documents, Website Services) plus paid consultations.

**Gap:** No mention of AI or automation. Messaging focuses on "real people" doing tasks manually. No clear path to recurring revenue. The three service categories don't map to Entry/Core/Ongoing tiers.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — This is prime real estate. Needs complete messaging overhaul to lead with AI accessibility, position website builds as the entry point, and tease automation/managed services as the destination.

**Tier support:** None (current), should support ALL tiers

**Priority:** HIGH

---

### Services (/services)

**Current purpose:** Comparison page for three service types (Virtual Assistant, Data & Documents, Website Services) with scenario-based pain points and pricing comparison.

**Gap:** Services are organized by task type, not by client journey. No progression from entry to ongoing. Website Services is buried as one of three equals rather than positioned as the door. No mention of AI-powered automation.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Restructure around the three tiers. Lead with Website Builds as entry, introduce automation setup as the core offering, position managed services as ongoing partnership.

**Tier support:** Partially Entry (Website Services exists but not prioritized)

**Priority:** HIGH

---

### Shop (/shop)

**Current purpose:** Sells consultation calls ($20/15min, $35/30min, $50/55min).

**Gap:** Consultations are disconnected from the three-tier model. They're positioned as standalone products rather than entry points to automation services. No upsell path visible.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Reframe consultations as "AI Readiness Assessments" or "Automation Discovery Calls." Use them to qualify leads for automation setup services.

**Tier support:** Could support Entry (as lead qualifier)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Blog (/blog)

**Current purpose:** Placeholder page showing "Coming Soon."

**Gap:** No content. Missed opportunity for thought leadership on AI for small business.

**Repurpose recommendation:** KEEP structure, but prioritize creating content that educates non-technical business owners on AI benefits. Topics: "What AI Can Do For Your Business (Without the Tech Headache)," case studies, automation wins.

**Tier support:** None currently, could support ALL tiers (awareness/education)

**Priority:** LOW (for now — focus on core pages first)

---

### Guide (/guide)

**Current purpose:** Platform documentation explaining how to use NeedThisDone (booking consultations, starting projects, account management).

**Gap:** Oriented toward existing task-based service model. No mention of automation workflows or AI tool setup. "For Admins" section suggests multi-user capability that isn't surfaced elsewhere.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Once service model changes, update to reflect new client journey: website build handoff, automation onboarding, managed service dashboard.

**Tier support:** None

**Priority:** LOW (dependent on service restructuring)

---

### Pricing (/pricing)

**Current purpose:** Three pricing tiers based on task complexity: Quick Task ($50), Standard Task ($150), Premium Service ($500+).

**Gap:** Pricing is complexity-based, not value-based or tier-based. No recurring revenue option visible. Website builds and automation aren't differentiated.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Restructure to match three-tier model:
- Entry: Website builds (one-time, clear deliverable)
- Core: Automation setup (one-time + monthly maintenance option)
- Ongoing: Managed AI services (monthly retainer)

**Tier support:** None (pricing doesn't align with tiers)

**Priority:** HIGH

---

### About (/about)

**Current purpose:** Personal story about Abe — background as Army Combat Medic, Toyota finance, now full-stack developer. Builds trust through authenticity.

**Gap:** Strong personal brand foundation, but no AI expertise positioning. "Full-stack developer" doesn't communicate AI/automation capability.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Keep the personal story but add positioning around AI implementation expertise. The "explain complicated things clearly" angle is perfect for the non-technical audience.

**Tier support:** None directly (brand/trust building)

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### FAQ (/faq)

**Current purpose:** Answers common questions about task types, tech requirements, timelines, pricing, and getting started.

**Gap:** Questions and answers assume manual task service. "Do I need to be tech-savvy?" is a great question but the answer doesn't mention AI tools being handled for them.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Update Q&A to address AI-specific concerns:
- "Will AI replace my workflow?"
- "How do I know which AI tools are right for my business?"
- "What happens if something breaks?"

**Tier support:** None

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### How It Works (/how-it-works)

**Current purpose:** Four-step process (Tell Us Your Needs → Get Your Quote → Authorize & We Begin → Review & Approve). Emphasizes "real people, not bots."

**Gap:** "Real people, not bots" messaging directly conflicts with AI-forward positioning. Process is generic project delivery, not AI implementation.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Reframe the process for AI services:
1. Discovery (understand their business)
2. Recommendation (which AI tools fit)
3. Implementation (set it up for them)
4. Support (ongoing management option)

**Tier support:** None

**Priority:** HIGH

---

### Contact / Get a Quote (/contact)

**Current purpose:** Lead capture form for custom project quotes.

**Gap:** Form fields are generic (name, email, company, "what kind of help"). No qualification for AI readiness or tier placement.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Add qualifying questions:
- Do you have a website? (Entry qualifier)
- Are you doing repetitive tasks manually? (Core qualifier)
- Do you want someone to manage your tools? (Ongoing qualifier)

**Tier support:** Could support Entry lead gen

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Get Started (/get-started)

**Current purpose:** Decision page offering two paths: Get a Quote (free) or Book a Consultation (paid).

**Gap:** Good conversion-focused page but paths don't lead to tier-specific outcomes.

**Repurpose recommendation:** REVISE — Restructure paths around tiers:
- "I need a website" → Entry
- "I want to automate something" → Core
- "I want ongoing help" → Ongoing

**Tier support:** Could support ALL tiers with revision

**Priority:** MEDIUM

## Summary: Priority Matrix

| Priority | Pages |

| MEDIUM | Shop, About, FAQ, Contact, Get Started |
| LOW | Blog, Guide |

## Key Observations

1. **"Real people, not bots" conflicts with AI positioning** — This messaging appears on multiple pages and will need systematic replacement.

2. **No recurring revenue path visible** — Current model is entirely project-based. Need to surface monthly/ongoing options prominently.

3. **Website Services is underpositioned** — It exists but competes equally with Virtual Assistant and Data & Documents instead of being the entry point.

4. **Strong infrastructure** — Site is well-built, navigation is clean, e-commerce (Stripe) is functional. Technical foundation is solid for pivot.

5. **Personal brand is an asset** — Abe's background and approachability fit the "make AI accessible" positioning. Just needs AI expertise layer added.
