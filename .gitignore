# Git Safety: Never commit secrets or build artifacts
# This file tells Git which files to ignore. Think of it as a bouncer at the door,
# making sure sensitive files and temporary build files never make it into version control.
#
# Two main categories we're protecting:
# 1. SECRETS - Environment variables, API keys, database passwords (never share these!)
# 2. BUILD ARTIFACTS - Generated files that can be recreated (they bloat the repo)

# Environment variables - each developer has their own secrets
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Node modules - install fresh from package.json on each machine
