  AI SITE ANALYSIS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
### 1. First Impression
Your homepage headline, "We build what you need done," clearly indicates a focus on project completion, but it doesn’t specify what kinds of projects or who your ideal clients are. The subheadline "Websites Small business tech that works as hard as you do" hints at small business services, which is helpful. However, visitors from Google might not instantly understand that you offer custom websites, automation, and AI services for small businesses. Consider making your main headline more explicit, like: **"Custom Websites, Automation, and AI for Small Businesses — Get Your Projects Done Right"** to immediately clarify your offerings.

### 2. Messaging Consistency
Your pages generally maintain a cohesive message around delivering practical tech solutions for small businesses. For example, the homepage emphasizes "Websites from $500," "Automation from $150," and "AI services $500/mo," which aligns with the detailed descriptions on /services. However, the /blog page feels more technical and less targeted at small business owners, which could seem disconnected. To improve consistency, incorporate more client-focused language across all pages, emphasizing how your solutions solve common small business pain points.

### 3. Service Clarity
Your service descriptions are clear and specific, especially on /services. For example, "Stop losing customers to a bad first impression" and "Automate the work you keep putting off" directly address client problems. The breakdown of what’s included, like "Custom design tailored to your brand" and "Search engine optimization built in from day one," makes it easy to understand what clients get. No major jargon issues are present; your explanations are straightforward and practical.

### 4. CTA Quality
Your CTAs like "See Packages from $500," "Book a Free 15-Min Call," and "Start Automating From $150 per workflow" are specific and action-oriented, which is good. However, some CTAs could be more compelling. For example, on the homepage, "See Packages from $500" could be enhanced to "View Packages & Start Your Project Today" to create urgency. Also, "Start a Project" on /work and "Book a Free 15-Min Call" are strong, but adding more benefit-focused language like "Get Your Custom Website Started Today" could boost conversions.

### 5. Trust & Credibility
Your site currently lacks testimonials, case studies, or client reviews, which are critical for building trust. The detailed project descriptions on /work, especially the "NeedThisDone.com" e-commerce platform, serve as strong proof of your capabilities. To enhance credibility, add client testimonials or brief case studies on /about or /work pages, highlighting specific results and client satisfaction. Displaying certifications or badges related to your expertise could also help.

### 6. Content Gaps
Your site covers the basics but misses some common small business website elements. For example:
- An **Testimonials or Client Success Stories** section is missing.
- A dedicated **Portfolio or Case Studies** page would showcase your work more effectively.
- An **About** page exists, but expanding it with client-focused messaging or success stories could strengthen trust.
- Consider adding a **Services Overview** page that consolidates all offerings with clear benefits.
- Including a **Testimonials** or **Reviews** section would significantly boost credibility.

### 7. Quick Wins (Top 5)
1. **Add Client Testimonials** on /about or /work to build trust immediately.
2. **Make your homepage headline more explicit** about your core services (e.g., "Custom Websites, Automation & AI for Small Businesses").
3. **Enhance CTAs** with benefit-driven language, such as "Start Your Project Today" or "Get Your Free Quote Now."
4. **Create a Portfolio or Case Studies page** to showcase your best work, especially the /work projects, with client results.
5. **Include a dedicated Testimonials or Reviews section** on the homepage or /about page to reinforce credibility.

Keep up the good work! Your site already communicates your technical expertise well; these tweaks will make it even more compelling for potential small business clients.
