# TODO First Rule

**Always update TODO.md before starting any task.**

## The Process

1. Read TODO.md to understand current state
2. Update task markers:
   - Mark your current task as `[→]` in progress
   - Ensure only ONE task is `[→]` at a time
3. THEN start the actual work
4. When done: mark `[x]` completed, run `/dac`

## Why This Matters

- User sees what you're working on
- Clear history of progress
- Prevents working on wrong things
- Makes handoffs smooth

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting code before updating TODO
- Working on multiple `[→]` tasks
- Forgetting to mark tasks `[x]` when done
- Not updating TODO at all

## Reminder

If you catch yourself coding before updating TODO - STOP.
Update the task list first. Then continue.
