1,The Problem,LinkedIn,"Most small businesses don't have a project problem.
They have a ""getting it across the finish line"" problem.

The website that's been ""almost done"" for 6 months.
The automation that would save 10 hours a week—if someone set it up.
The AI tools everyone talks about but nobody's implemented.

You know what needs to happen. You just need someone to make it happen.

That's why I built needthisdone.com.

→ What's been sitting on your back burner?","Premium 3D render of a minimalist white desk with a MacBook showing a loading bar stuck at 87%. Soft morning light from the left. A small sticky note on the desk reads ""needthisdone.com"" in clean sans-serif font. Muted green and blue gradient glow behind the laptop. Ultra-clean, modern workspace aesthetic. No people. Photorealistic lighting with soft shadows. 4K quality."
1,The Problem,Instagram,"87% done is 0% shipped.

Your to-do list isn't the problem.
It's the stuff that never makes it ON the list.

needthisdone.com →","Bold typographic design on dark slate background. Large ""87%"" in glowing green neon style, with ""DONE"" crossed out below it and ""SHIPPED"" written in purple. Bottom corner shows ""needthisdone.com"" in minimal white text. Subtle glassmorphism card effect behind the numbers. Modern, punchy, Instagram-native vertical format. Premium design aesthetic with soft purple and green color accents."
1,The Problem,Facebook,"Real talk: How many projects are sitting in your ""I'll get to it"" pile?

For me, before I started Need This Done, it was embarrassing. Websites half-built. Automations sketched on napkins. Ideas that deserved better than collecting dust.

Small businesses don't fail from lack of ideas. They stall because there's no one to execute.

That's the gap I built needthisdone.com to fill.

What's yours gathering dust?","Warm lifestyle photo style: A cozy home office desk with soft natural window light. An open notebook with hand-drawn wireframes, a cold cup of coffee, and a phone showing the needthisdone.com homepage. Plants in background, slightly blurred. Warm gold and soft blue tones. Relatable, approachable, real. The URL is visible on the phone screen. Photorealistic, editorial quality."
2,The Origin,LinkedIn,"5 years as an Army Combat Medic.
7 years in automotive finance at Toyota.
Now I build websites and automations.

Weird path? Maybe.

But here's what carried over:

→ Staying calm when everything's on fire
→ Explaining complicated things without jargon
→ Following through, no matter what

Clients don't hire me for my résumé.
They hire me because when I say it'll get done, it gets done.

Center card: car key fob with blue glow. Right card: code brackets </> with purple glow. Cards have glassmorphism effect with subtle reflections. ""needthisdone.com"" appears below in clean white text. Premium, minimal, professional. Soft colored lighting from each card."
2,The Origin,Instagram,"Combat Medic.
Finance Manager.
Developer.

Not a pivot. A progression.

Pressure → Process → Product.

Same discipline. Different battlefield.

needthisdone.com →","Vertical Instagram format. Three horizontal bands of color (green top, blue middle, purple bottom) with bold white text overlaid: ""MEDIC"" / ""FINANCE"" / ""DEVELOPER"" - each word on its respective color band. Modern brutalist typography. Subtle texture overlay. ""needthisdone.com"" in small gold text at bottom. High contrast, bold, scroll-stopping design."
2,The Origin,Facebook,"People ask how I went from Army medic to building websites.

Honestly? It's not that different.

In the Army, you assess the situation, prioritize what matters, and execute under pressure. In finance, you learn to translate complex stuff into plain English. In development, you take a problem and build the solution.

Different skills. Same mindset: figure it out and get it done.

That's the whole philosophy behind needthisdone.com.

What's your unexpected career path? I love hearing these.","Warm editorial-style image: A wooden desk with three items arranged thoughtfully - a folded American flag in a triangle case, a Toyota keychain, and a laptop showing lines of code. Soft golden hour lighting from a window. The laptop has a small sticker visible that says ""needthisdone.com"". Nostalgic but modern feel. Rich warm tones with touches of green and blue. Photorealistic lifestyle photography style."
3,The Solution,LinkedIn,"What we build at Need This Done:

→ Websites — Custom sites that actually convert, not template nightmares
→ Automation — Stop doing manually what software can do for you
→ Managed AI — AI tools set up and maintained so you can focus on your work

We're not an agency with 47 account managers.
We're a small team that treats your project like our own.

If it's been on your list too long, let's get it done.

3,The Solution,Instagram,"We do three things.
We do them well.

→ Websites
→ Automation
→ AI Services

No fluff. No bloat. Just shipped projects.

Clean, modern, icon-forward design. Vertical Instagram format."
3,The Solution,Facebook,"So what exactly do you do?

I get this question a lot. Here's the simple version:

If you need a website built — we do that.
If you're doing repetitive tasks that software could handle — we automate that.
If you want to use AI but don't know where to start — we set that up and manage it.

Basically: you tell us what's stuck, we unstick it.

Small businesses. Agencies. Anyone who's tired of projects collecting dust.

A hand holding a coffee mug entering frame. Warm natural lighting. Green, blue, and purple sticky notes. Organized but lived-in feel. Approachable and real."
4,The Philosophy,LinkedIn,"Hot take: AI doesn't replace expertise. It amplifies it.

I use AI tools every day. They help me work faster and catch things I'd miss.

But here's what AI can't do:

→ Understand what your business actually needs
→ Make judgment calls when requirements conflict
→ Build relationships and trust over time
→ Take ownership when something goes wrong

The strategy is human. The quality control is human. The accountability is human.

AI is the tool. I'm the craftsman.

The human hand has warm skin tones, the AI hand is sleek chrome with purple LED accents. They meet in the middle over a floating holographic display showing ""needthisdone.com"". Dark background with soft green and blue ambient lighting. Premium, futuristic but warm. Symbolizes collaboration, not replacement."
4,The Philosophy,Instagram,"AI is the tool.
I'm the craftsman.

Speed without strategy is just fast chaos.

Human judgment. AI horsepower.

That's the formula.

needthisdone.com →","Split-screen vertical design. Left side: chaotic, glitchy AI-generated noise in grayscale. Right side: clean, organized website design in full color with green, blue, purple accents. A vertical gold line divides them. Text overlay: ""TOOL"" on left, ""CRAFTSMAN"" on right. ""needthisdone.com"" at bottom in white. High contrast, thought-provoking, Instagram-native."
4,The Philosophy,Facebook,"I'll be honest about something: I use AI every single day in my work.

But probably not the way you think.

AI helps me move faster. It catches typos. It suggests solutions I might not have considered. It's like having a really smart assistant who never sleeps.

What it doesn't do? Make decisions. Understand your business. Take responsibility.

That's still me. That's always going to be me.

When you hire needthisdone.com, you get cutting-edge tools guided by real human judgment. That combo is what actually gets results.

How do you feel about AI in professional services? Curious to hear takes.","Warm photo of a person's workspace (hands visible, face cropped out) with a laptop showing AI code suggestions on screen, but the person's hand is on a physical notebook making handwritten notes and decisions.

5,The Invitation,LinkedIn,"You don't need another meeting about your project.
