# Site Analysis Request — needthisdone.com

## What This Is
A page-by-page review of our current website to identify 
what can be repurposed toward our new direction.

Do NOT create any content. Only analyze and recommend.

## Current State
- Site is live and fully deployed
- Infrastructure exists and works
- Messaging is outdated and unclear
- No consistent social media presence
- No recurring revenue model in place

## Where We Want to Go

**Vision:** Make AI tools accessible for non-technical 
small business owners.

**Outcome for clients:** They get the benefits of tools 
like Claude and ChatGPT without learning prompts, 
terminals, or workflows.

**Service Tiers:**

| Tier | What They Get | Revenue |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Entry | Website build | One-time |
| Core | Automation setup (content, workflows) | One-time + monthly |
| Ongoing | Managed AI services | Recurring |

Website builds are the door. Automation is the destination.

## What I Need From You

For each page on the site:

1. **Current purpose** — What is this page trying to do now?
2. **Gap** — How does it miss the three-tier model?
3. **Repurpose recommendation** — Keep, revise, merge, or remove?
4. **Which tier does it support?** — Entry / Core / Ongoing / None
5. **Priority** — High / Medium / Low

## Output Format
Create a markdown file: `outputs/site-analysis.md`

Organize by page. No fluff — just observations and recommendations.
