# Premium Upgrade - Success Criteria

## The Goal

Every page looks like it was crafted by a senior designer who sweats the details—not generated by AI following a template.

## Visual Consistency Checklist

### Borders (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **All cards use identical border treatment**: `border border-gray-200/60`
- [ ] **All section containers use identical border treatment**
- [ ] **No thick borders anywhere** (no `border-2`, no `border-gray-400`)
- [ ] **Homepage "How It Works" matches "Transparent Pricing" border**
- [ ] **Pricing add-ons don't use dashed borders**

### Shadows
- [ ] **Cards have subtle resting shadow**: `shadow-[0_1px_3px_rgba(0,0,0,0.04)]`
- [ ] **Interactive cards lift on hover**: `-translate-y-1` + increased shadow
- [ ] **No harsh drop shadows**

### Spacing
- [ ] **Consistent padding inside cards** (p-6 or p-8, not mixed)
- [ ] **Consistent gaps between cards** (gap-6)
- [ ] **Consistent section margins** (mb-16)

### Border Radius
- [ ] **All cards use same radius**: `rounded-2xl` (16px)
- [ ] **All buttons use same radius**: `rounded-xl` (12px)
- [ ] **No mixing of rounded-lg/rounded-xl/rounded-2xl on same page**

## Animation & Interaction Checklist

### Page Load
- [ ] **Every page has entrance animations** (fade-up on scroll/load)
- [ ] **Animations are staggered** (100-200ms delays between elements)
- [ ] **No jarring or instant appearances**

### Hover States
- [ ] **All clickable cards have hover effect** (lift + shadow)
- [ ] **All buttons have hover state** (color shift or scale)
- [ ] **Hover transitions are smooth** (300ms ease-out)

### Micro-interactions
- [ ] **Links have underline on hover OR color change**
- [ ] **Icons have subtle animation where appropriate**

---

## Typography Checklist

### Hierarchy
- [ ] **Clear size difference between headline and body** (minimum 2x)
- [ ] **Section titles are consistent size across pages**
- [ ] **Body text is consistent size** (16px base)

### Readability
- [ ] **Line height is comfortable** (1.5-1.75 for body)
- [ ] **Paragraph max-width limits line length** (~65 characters)
- [ ] **Sufficient contrast** (WCAG AA minimum)

- [ ] **Human but professional**

### Structure

### Objection Handling

## Technical Criteria

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Using `premium-design.ts` utilities** (not hardcoded styles)
- [ ] **No duplicate style definitions**
- [ ] **Consistent import patterns**

### Performance

## The Gut Check

When someone lands on any page, they should think:

1. **"This looks polished"** — No rough edges, everything aligned
2. **"This feels intentional"** — Every element has a purpose
3. **"This is easy to use"** — Clear hierarchy, obvious next steps
4. **"This is memorable"** — At least one detail that delights

---

## Verification Workflow

For each page redesign, follow this process:

### Step 1: Implement Changes
- Update code using `premium-design.ts` utilities
- Apply consistent borders, shadows, spacing
- Add animations

### Step 2: Chrome Review (REQUIRED)
- Open page in Chrome browser
- Full-page scroll to check visual flow
- Test all hover states and interactions
- Check animations trigger correctly
- Compare side-by-side with homepage for consistency

### Step 3: Capture & Compare
- Take new full-page screenshot
- Compare with original screenshot
- Verify border consistency is fixed
- Check no visual regressions

### Step 4: Tweak & Iterate
- Note any issues found during Chrome review
- Make adjustments as needed
- Re-verify in Chrome after changes
- Repeat until page passes gut check

### Step 5: Mobile Check
- Test responsive behavior
- Verify touch interactions work
- Check spacing on smaller screens
