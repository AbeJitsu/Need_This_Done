## Section 1: Professional Summary

### CURRENT
```
Started as an Army combat medic leading a team of five, then spent seven
years at Toyota earning three promotions to Finance Manager. I've been
learning web development since 2016, building consistently while working
full-time, and went full-time as a developer in 2023. My approach stays
the same wherever I work: stay calm, figure out what's broken, and deliver
what I promise.
```

### PROPOSED (Warm, conversational tone - like talking to a trusted friend)
```
Three years building production applications, grounded in seven years of
learning the craft while working full-time. I started with tutorials in
2016 and kept at it until I was confident enough to go all-in as a
developer in 2023. I'm still learning today, currently working through
freeCodeCamp's Full Stack Developer certification. Before tech, I led a
five-person medic team in the Army and earned three promotions at Toyota
over seven years. What's stayed consistent: I stay calm when things break,
I explain technical stuff without making people feel dumb, and I follow
through on what I say I'll do.
```

WHY:      - Moved Node.js/Python to backend box
          - Added HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript explicitly (job lists these)
          - Added Tailwind (you use it daily in this project)
```

#### Box 2: Backend & Databases (was "Databases")
```
CURRENT:  PostgreSQL, Supabase, Redis, MongoDB

PROPOSED: Node.js, Python, REST APIs, PostgreSQL,
          Supabase, Redis, MongoDB

WHY:      - Combined backend + databases (cleaner)
          - Shows full-stack depth
```

## Section 3: Professional Experience

### Job 1: needthisdone.com - WARMER TONE + TECHNICAL DEPTH

#### CURRENT
```
• Built and launched an e-commerce site that's live and taking orders
• Built the whole thing myself: the website, the server, the database,
  the payment system
• Added an AI chatbot that answers customer questions based on site content
• Set up automated tests so updates don't break what's already working
```

#### PROPOSED (Warm but technically specific)
```
• Built and launched a responsive e-commerce platform that's live and
  handling real customer orders. Designed mobile-first so it works on
  any device
• Handled the full stack myself: React/Next.js frontend, Node.js backend,
  PostgreSQL database, and Stripe for payments
• Added an AI chatbot that answers customer questions by searching the
  actual site content. Saves time for both customers and me
• Set up automated testing with Playwright so I can ship updates
  confidently without breaking what's already working
```

#### WHY THIS WORKS
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WARM: "saves time for both customers and me" → shows you think about UX   │
│  SPECIFIC: Lists actual tech stack (React, Node, PostgreSQL, Stripe)       │
│  HONEST: "handled myself" not "architected" → confident without buzzwords  │
│  JOB MATCH: "responsive", "mobile-first" → direct job requirement match    │
│                                                                             │

│  1. Started as contractor doing API work                                    │
│  2. Proved yourself, got hired for onboarding                               │
│  3. Had full-stack skills the hybrid devs had                               │
│  4. CEO wasn't technical - needed someone to explain things                 │
│  5. The other devs weren't as patient with his questions                    │
│  6. You became the bridge because you COULD explain without attitude        │
│                                                                             │
│  This is actually a GREAT story - it shows soft skills + technical depth    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### CURRENT
```
Title: Technical Operations Specialist

• Served as the primary technical liaison between the CEO and an 8-person
  team, translating business needs into development priorities and helping
  non-technical leadership make informed decisions
```

#### PROPOSED (Warm, honest, conversational)
```
Title: Technical Operations Specialist (keep it - it's accurate)

• Started as a contractor doing API integration work. Did good work, got
  brought on for client onboarding
• Became the person the CEO came to with technical questions. Not because
  I was the only developer, but because I took the time to explain things
  in a way that made sense to him
• Automated the repetitive stuff that was slowing the team down so people
  could focus on work that actually mattered
• Handled data migrations during client onboarding. Turned multi-day
  headaches into same-day completions while improving accuracy
```

#### WHY THIS WORKS
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HONEST: Shows you earned the role through good work, not given it         │
│  WARM: "took the time to explain" → considerate, patient                   │

### Jobs 3-6: NO CHANGES

The Freelance, Toyota, Full Sail, and Army roles are good as-is. They show:
- Career progression
- Communication skills
- Leadership under pressure
- Customer-facing experience

## Section 4: Featured Project

### CURRENT
```
An e-commerce site I built from scratch: the website, the server, the
database, the payment system. Customers can browse, sign up, check out,
and track orders. There's an admin dashboard for managing the business.
An AI chatbot answers questions based on what's on the site. Automated
tests catch problems before customers ever see them.
```

### PROPOSED
```
A responsive, mobile-first e-commerce platform built from the ground up.
Features include user authentication, product browsing, shopping cart,
secure checkout with Stripe, and order tracking. The admin dashboard
provides business management tools. An AI-powered chatbot handles customer
questions using semantic search. Comprehensive automated testing ensures
reliable deployments.
```

### TECH STACK LINE - CURRENT
```
Next.js • TypeScript • Supabase • Redis • Stripe • Docker • Playwright
```

### TECH STACK LINE - PROPOSED
```
React/Next.js • TypeScript • Node.js • PostgreSQL/Supabase • Redis •
Stripe • Playwright • Vercel
```

### NOTE
```
Removed Docker from project tech stack (not using in this project).
Docker + Nginx stay in Skills section (you have experience with both).
```

### WHY
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Added "responsive, mobile-first" → direct job requirement match            │
│  Added "React/Next.js" → job specifically asks for React                    │
│  Added "Node.js" → shows backend capability                                 │
│  Added "Vercel" → shows cloud deployment experience                         │

## Section 5: Education - MINOR REFRAME

### CURRENT
```
Self-Directed Learning (2016 - 2023): Six years of consistent study while
working full-time at Toyota. Built projects, followed tutorials, read
documentation. That groundwork made going full-time as a developer possible.
```

### PROPOSED
```
Self-Directed Learning (2016 - 2023): Eight years of consistent skill
development while working full-time. Progressed from tutorials to building
production applications. This sustained commitment built the foundation
for professional development work.
```

### WHY
```

## Questions Before Proceeding

1. **Summary rewrite** - Does the new lead ("Eight years building web applications") feel accurate to you?

2. **Skills reorganization** - The new 6-box layout front-loads job keywords. Good?

3. **Acadio reframe** - "Technical advisor to CEO" captures your role without overclaiming?

4. **Tech language upgrade** - The bullets are more technical now. Does this feel like you?

5. **Anything to add/remove?** - Other projects, skills, or experiences worth including?
