The stack you listed - Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vercel - is what I use daily. needthisdone.com runs on it.

The site has a component-based page builder where users drag and drop blocks to create pages. Sounds similar to the shared design system you mentioned. It also passes WCAG AA accessibility checks, which I saw was a focus for this role.

I haven't used AWS Lambda or DynamoDB, but I've built with serverless patterns on Vercel and cloud databases through Supabase. Same concepts, different provider.

The AI chatbot on my platform pulls from internal data to answer questions - relevant to the R&D work you described around real-time data and audience engagement tools.

Happy to show you how any of it works.
