# Cover Letter - Orchid Software Solutions

## Lead Full-Stack Engineer (Next.js)

---

**INVITING**

Building software for fertility clinics means your code touches people at one of the most hopeful and vulnerable moments of their lives. That's not just another SaaS product - that's work worth doing well. When I saw you're looking for someone to own architecture and ship AI features in Next.js, I wanted in.

**FOCUSED**

I'm a full-stack developer whose primary stack is exactly what you're building with: Next.js, TypeScript, Node, and Python. I recently shipped needthisdone.com - a production platform with 165 React components, 72 API routes, a visual page editor, and an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI embeddings. I architected it, built it, and maintain it.

**CONSIDERATE**

You need a player-coach who can make architectural decisions and ship code, not just delegate. Someone who can partner with Product and Design to turn ideas into working software. And you need someone who can communicate technical concepts clearly - whether that's mentoring a junior dev or explaining a tradeoff to a stakeholder.

**SUPPORTIVE**

Here's what I've shipped:

- **Visual Editor**: Drag-and-drop page builder with 30+ components, inline text editing, and version history. Non-technical users update content without touching code.
- **AI Integration**: Chatbot using OpenAI GPT and vector embeddings that understands context and answers questions from internal data.
- **Production Infrastructure**: Stripe payments, Google OAuth, automated emails, Redis caching, PostgreSQL - all wired together and running in production.
- **Documentation**: My README has been called "a technical writing sample" - because clear documentation is how teams scale.

I've also written Python scripts to transform messy PDFs into structured HTML, handled data migrations that turned multi-day problems into same-day solutions, and became the person executives came to when they needed technical concepts explained in plain language.

**INFLUENTIAL**

I know the job asks for 7+ years. I have fewer years but more reps - I've built a complete production system from the ground up, made the architectural decisions, and lived with the consequences. I'd welcome the chance to show you what I can do.

Let's talk.
