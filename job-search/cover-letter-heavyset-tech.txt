Outcome-driven work with clear ownership. That's exactly how I like to operate.

When I build something, I own it end-to-end until it's production-ready and documented. The deliverable isn't done until someone else can pick it up and run with it.

Here's what I bring that matches what you need:

CSS, HTML, JavaScript at a senior level. I've built responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid, handled cross-browser quirks, and shipped interfaces that work on every device. My recent work on needthisdone.com includes custom form components and WCAG AA accessibility compliance across the entire application.

React experience in production. I build with Next.js and TypeScript daily. Component architecture, hooks, context providers, the works. I've also extended existing React applications at Acadio where I joined mid-project and started contributing quickly.

GitHub workflows are second nature. I use PR-based development with proper branching, write meaningful commit messages, and understand that clean version control is part of the deliverable.

I understand you're accelerating client onboarding with custom form implementations. Each form needs to be polished, documented, and ready for the client to deploy. The deployment instruction pages you mentioned (copy-paste code, screenshots, clear steps) tell me you value quality handoffs. That's exactly how I work. I document as I build because I know someone else has to pick it up.

A few things from my recent work that show what I mean:

- Built a visual page editor where non-technical users can create and edit pages without touching code. End-to-end, including documentation.
- Created 137 automated tests covering the full user journey. If something breaks, I know immediately.
- Converted messy PDF textbooks into clean, responsive HTML at Acadio. Transformed multi-day headaches into same-day completions.

Prior contract experience? Yes. I've worked as an independent contractor and delivered on what I committed to.

I'm ready for the identity verification process and can start quickly. If my background fits what you're looking for, I'd welcome a conversation about the work.
