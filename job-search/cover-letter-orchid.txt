You're building software for fertility clinics - tools that help real people through something that matters. That kind of work needs to be reliable, and the team building it needs someone who can own the technical direction while still writing code every day.

That's the kind of work I do. I built needthisdone.com from the ground up - a platform where users drag and drop to build pages, edit text directly on screen, and ask questions to a chatbot that understands the business. When the role mentions partnering with Product and Design to turn vision into working software, that's how I've been working.

At my last company, I became the person the CEO came to when technical concepts needed explaining clearly. When messy PDFs needed converting to usable content, I wrote the Python scripts. When data migrations were taking days, I figured out how to get them done same-day.

You mentioned wanting AI features integrated with internal data - that's exactly what the chatbot on my platform does. Would be glad to walk through how it works.
