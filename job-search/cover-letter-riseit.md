To the RiseIT team,

One line in your job posting caught my attention: "communicate directly with peers, managers, and clients while leading development to a completed and successful solution across both technical and marketing groups."

That's describing someone who can write good code *and* explain it to people who don't write code. That's the work I actually enjoy.

Here's what I'd bring:

- React, Next.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, jQuery. Started learning in 2016, seven years building the foundation while working full-time before going all-in as a developer.
- Full-stack experience from UI design down to PostgreSQL and REST APIs
- Mobile-first, responsive design on every project
- A live e-commerce platform at needthisdone.com that handles actual customer orders

During those years of learning, I was at Toyota explaining complicated finance options to customers. That taught me something tutorials don't cover: how to make technical things make sense to people who aren't technical.

Your listing mentions managing multiple timelines in a fast-moving environment. Five years as an Army medic and seven years juggling multiple finance deals daily at a high-volume dealership built that muscle. At this point it's just how I work.

At Acadio, the CEO started coming to me with technical questions because my explanations made sense to him. Data migrations that used to take days? Same-day turnarounds with better accuracy.

My background is JavaScript/Node.js rather than .NET. I've got solid OOP fundamentals and I pick up new stacks quickly. Learned React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL while working full-time. Still learning today.

I'm local to Orlando and available to start right away. Would love to chat about how I could help.

Thanks for reading,
Abe Reyes
