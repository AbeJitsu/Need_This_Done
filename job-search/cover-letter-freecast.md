To the FreeCast team,

An app that brings all streaming content into one place solves a real problem. I've got five different streaming services and finding what I want to watch shouldn't require opening four apps first. SmartGuide sounds like the fix.

Here's what I'd bring to your marketing and sales sites:

- React and Next.js are my daily tools. Built a full e-commerce platform at needthisdone.com from scratch with them.
- Mobile-first responsive design on every project. I start with the phone layout and work up.
- Figma and Photoshop for design work, then I build what I design.
- API integration experience, including Stripe payments and third-party services.

You're looking for someone who can design landing pages and then build them. That's exactly what I do. I don't hand off a mockup and wait for someone else to code it. I see it through from concept to deployed.

At Toyota, I spent seven years explaining complicated options to customers in ways that made sense. That skill transfers directly to marketing sites. I know how to present information so people actually understand it and take action.

I'm in Orlando and happy to work on-site at your TPC office. Ready to start whenever works for you.

Thanks for reading,
Abe Reyes
